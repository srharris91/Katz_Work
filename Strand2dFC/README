Strand2dFC solves the compressible Navier-Stokes equations on a single block
of 2d strand grid.  The solver features high-order spatial discretizations
(FC stands for the "flux correction" high order method),
BDF time discretizations, and Paraview output.

To compile the block solver library:
	1. Set the proper paths and compiler options in Make.rules
		SOLVER = current path to Strand2dFC
		SOLVERLIB = desired name of solver library
		PHYSICS = path to the "Physics" library needed by
			  Strand2dFC. Note: the Physics library
			  needs to be compiled beforehand.
	2. Type "make library".

To generate Doxygen documentation of the Strand2dFC library:
	1. Install Doxygen on your system if you don't already have it.
	2. Type "make documentation".
	3. Open the file Strand2dFC/doc/html/index.html which contains the
	   main page of the documentation.

To remove the library, documentation, and any object files:
	1. Type "make clean".
