  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an assessment of a variety of reconstruction schemes on meshes with both quadrilateral
and triangular tessellations. The investigations measure the order of accuracy, absolute error, and convergence
properties associated with each method. Linear reconstruction approaches using both Green-Gauss and least-
squares gradient estimation are evaluated against a structured MUSCL scheme wherever possible. In addition to
examining the influence of polygon degree and reconstruction strategy, results with three limiters are examined and
compared against unlimited results when feasible. The methods are applied on quadrilateral, right triangular, and
equilateral triangular elements to facilitate an examination of the scheme's behavior on a variety of element shapes.
The numerical test cases include well-known internal and external inviscid examples and also a supersonic vortex
problem for which there exists a closed-form solution to the two-dimensional compressible Euler equations. Such
investigations indicate that the least-squares gradient estimation provides significantly more reliable results on poor
quality meshes. Furthermore, limiting only the face normal component of the gradient can significantly increase
both accuracy and convergence while still preserving the integral cell average and maintaining monoticity. The
first-order method performs poorly on stretched triangular meshes, and analysis shows that such meshes result
in poorly aligned left and right states for the Riemann problem. The higher average valence of a vertex in the
triangular tesselations does not appear to enhance the wave propagation, accuracy, or convergence properties of
the method. Typically, quadrilateral elements provide superior or equivalent discrete solutions with approximately
50% fewer edges in the domain two-dimensional. However, on very poor quality meshes, the triangular elements
routinely yield superior accuracy as a result of the trapezoidal quadrature of the Galerkin portion of the numerical
flux function.},

  Abstract                 = {Various numerical and practical aspects associated with the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on
triangular meshes are addressed. We depart from the standard “element” data structure used in finite elements
which describes a mesh element-wise from knowledge of the vertices of each element. Instead, we use an “edge”
data structure which describes a mesh edge-wise given the vertices of each edge and neigboring cell information.
In developing algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations, the use of the edge data structure necessitates the
rederivation of many of the discrete operators appearing in the Navier-Stokes equations. In this paper, edge for-
mulas for the Galerkin and finite-volume discretization of gradient, divergence, Hessian and Laplacian operators
are derived. The Galerkin discretieation (with linear elements) of the Laplacian operator reveals that a discrete
maximum principle is guaranteed in two space dimensions if and only if the mesh is a Delaunay triangulation.
Sufficient conditions for a discrete maximum principle in three space dimensions are developed and found to be
in agreement with standard finite element theory. Other issues which are equally important in the solution of
the Navier-Stokes equations are addressed. Some issues concerning the generation of highly stretched triangular
meshes are reviewed. A triangulation method which minimizes the maximum angle in triangles is shown t o have
desirable properties for highly stretched meshes. Other practical aspects of computing Navier-Stokes flow includ-
ing the modeling of turbulence on unstructured meshes are discussed and a new turbulence modeling strategy
is presented. The turbulence modeling capability is then coupled with au implicit solution strategy. Numerical
results for high Reynolds number flow about single and multi-element airfoils are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Gradient approximation methods commonly used in unstructured-grid finite-volume schemes
intended for solutions of high Reynolds number flow equations are studied comprehensively. The
accuracy of gradients within cells and within faces is evaluated systematically for both node-centered
and cell-centered formulations. Computational and analytical evaluations are made on a series of
high-aspect-ratio grids with different primal elements, including quadrilateral, triangular, and mixed-
element grids, with and without random perturbations to the mesh. Both rectangular and cylindrical
geometries are considered; the latter serves to study the effects of geometric curvature. The study
shows that the accuracy of gradient reconstruction on high-aspect-ratio grids is determined by a
combination of the grid and the solution. The contributors to the error are identified and approaches
to reduce errors are given, including the addition of higher-order terms in the direction of larger
mesh spacing. A parameter Γ characterizing accuracy on curved high-aspect-ratio grids is discussed
and an approximate-mapped-least-square method using a commonly-available distance function is
presented; the method provides accurate gradient reconstruction on general grids. The study is
intended to be a reference guide accompanying the construction of accurate and efficient methods
for high Reynolds number applications.},
