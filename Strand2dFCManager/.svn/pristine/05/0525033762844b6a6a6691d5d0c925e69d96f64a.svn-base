Strand2dFCManager manages the Strand2dFC single block 2d strand grid solver.
The manager reads in a surface mesh, generates strand grids on multiple
multigrid levels, and invokes the unsteady block solver to compute flow and
generate output.

To compile the meshing executable (only generates the strand mesh for testing
of the strand generation procedure, and does not solve the flow equations):
        1. Set the proper paths and compiler options in Make.rules
		MANAGER = current path to Strand2dFCManager
		MANAGERLIB = desired name of manager library
                SOLVER = path to Strand2dFC block solver
                SOLVERLIB = name of solver library to link to. NOTE: the
	                    Strand2dFC block solver library must be compiled
	                    beforehand.
                PHYSICS = path to Physics library
                PHYSICSLIB = name of Physics library to link to. NOTE: the
	                     Physics library must be compiled beforehand.
        2. Type "make driver".
	3. A .exec file will be created in the Strand2dFCManager/run/ directory.
	2. Type ./Strand2dFCManager.exec "inputFile" to test strand meshing.

To compile the flow solver executable:
	1. Follow step 1 for the meshing executable above
	2. Type "make solver".
	3. A .exec file will be created in the Strand2dFCManager/run/ directory.

To run cases:
	1. Create imput file. NOTE: See Strand2dFCManager/run/input.namelist.notes
	   for a description of meshing and solver inputs.
	2. Type ./Strand2dFCSolver.exec "inputFile"
	3. An unsteady flow configuration around a circular cylinder is setup in the
	   Strand2dFCManager/run/circle/ directory. The Strouhal number corresponding
	   to the unsteady shedding behavior may be computed from the unsteady lift
	   signal by using the fft_shed.m Matlab routine.

To remove the library  and any object files:
        1. Type "make clean".
