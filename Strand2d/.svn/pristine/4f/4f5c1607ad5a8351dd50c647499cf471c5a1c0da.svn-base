To compile strand3d:

0. Before strand3d may be compiled, it is necessary to compile the
   strandGen meshing layer library. Go the the main directory of
   strandGen and edit Make.incl:

   STRANDGEN = directory where strandGen is located
   F90, FFLAGS, CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS, LDLIBS as desired   
   ARCCFD = directory where the strand3d solver resides

   Then type "make libr" to create the strandGen library. See the README
   in strandGen for a detailed description of the major components of
   strandGen.

1. Go to the main strand3d directory.

2. Edit Make.rules for your system.  Here are the descriptions:

   EXEC = name of executable that will be placed in the "run"
   directory.
   TECLIB = library from Tecplot distribution needed to write Tecplot
   unformatted files.  Note a linux and Mac version are included in
   the "lib" directory.
   ARCCFDLIB = name of library created when strand3d is compiled. This
   library is moved to the "lib" directory and links with
   src/main/Main.C when used in stand alone mode.
   STRANDGEN = location of strandGen meshing layer
   ARCCFD = location of strand3d
   STRANDGENLIB = name of the library containing the meshing layer
   routines. This library is found in $(STRANDGEN)/lib/

   Other compilers and flags as needed.

3. Type "make cdriver" to create the $(ARCCFDLIB) and link with
   the strandGen library and src/main/Main.C to form a stand alone
   executable in the "run" directory.


   
To run strand3d:

1. In the "run" directory, type "./strand3d_c". Make sure the following files
   are present:

      mesh.strand3d - unformatted surface mesh file
      strand.input - inputs to strandGen meshing layer
      solver.input - inputs to strand3d solver
      bc.channel - contains boundary condition specification for
		   each boundary and surface patch. Note: the name of
		   this file is specified in solver.input.

   The inputs in strand.input are described in the strandGen/notes directory.

   The inputs in solver.input and the boundary condition file are described
   in the strand3d/notes directory.

2. Several Tecplot files are optionally output upon execution of the code:

   surfMesh.plt - surface mesh
   volMesh.plt - volume mesh
   partitions.plt - plot of each surface partition (under progress)
   convNB.dat - convergence history (delta Q)
   surface.000000.plt - plot of surface quantities
   solution.000000.plt - field plot of Q
   residual.000000.plt - field plot of delta Q
   error.000000.plt - field plot of error (if using an exact/MMS solution)
