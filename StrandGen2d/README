To compile strandGen2d, edit Make.rules, then type "make libr". This will
make a library to which you may link a main file to run the strand
meshing routines. I have included a main.C file in the "driver" directory.
To make an executable for testing, type "make driver."
In the Makefile, ARCCFD should be set to the
directory containing the strand block solver.

To run the test executable, go the the "driver" directory and type "./strandGen2d"

Here are the modules of strandGen:

1. StrandGlobalMesh
   - singleton instance (sgm) 
   - reads input file and stores these inputs
   - reads mesh file and stores the global mesh data
   - partitions the global mesh into StrandBlocks, which are stored here
     in the StrandGlobalMesh.

2. StrandMultiBlockMesh
   - singleton instance (smbm)
   - manages the methods of the StrandBlocks to prepare them for the solver
   - methods include initialize, sprout, print

3. StrandBlock
   - multiple (nStrandblocks) objects
   - methods include print, renumbering, and all the sprout methods.
   - holds all strand mesh data (which reduces to surface data)

4. StrandMultiBlockSolver
   - singleton instance (smbs)
   - manages multiblock solution procedure, including multigrid
   - methods include initialize, take step, output data

5. StrandBlockSolver
   - multiple (nStrandBlocks*nLevels) objects (nLevels is # of MG levels.)
   - each fine level StrandBlockSolver is initialized with its
     corresponding StrandBlock and points to all its data. Coarse
     level StrandBlockSolvers will be initialized by their parent
     StrandBlockSolvers.
   - this is actually part of the CFD solver and resides with the
     solver, not strandGen
   - holds all solver related data for a block
   - calls the "control" layer routines for the solver written in fortran
