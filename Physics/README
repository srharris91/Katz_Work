Physics is a set of routines to perform common physics-based tasks
often needed by CFD codes, such as handling of equations of state
and computation of transport properties (viscosity, conduction, etc.)

To compile the Physics library:
        1. Set the proper paths and compiler options in Make.rules
                PHYSICS = current path to Physics
                PHYSICSLIB = desired name of Physics library
        2. Type "make library".

To remove the library and any object files:
        1. Type "make clean".

To compile documentation via Doxygen:
        1. Type "make documentation".
